# Energy Monitor

![Poster](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/marcelinollano/energy-monitor/master/Assets/Poster.jpg)

I wanted to make a project with as much hype as possible. Hold your horses this project features: An Arduino, a Raspberry Pi, a Rails API and client with server push through Faye, responsive layout using Bootstrap and an iOS mobile app. I wanted to use Node.js and put a map in there but I ran out of time. For the next time.

The idea was to prototype as fast as I could a proof of concept of an Internet connected device. I chose to do an energy monitor. The idea is pretty simple: I have a thingy at home that consumes energy, I want to send how much energy consumes to a central webapp through an API. This API will be consumed by the iOS mobile app and I will also have a responsive web version, of course.

Here is a quick demo demo of the end result:
